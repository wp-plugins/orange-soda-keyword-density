Plugin from OrangeSoda that displays top 6 keywords for a post/page along with the density of each word.

== Description ==

This is a plugin from OrangeSoda written by David Godfrey. The Plugin adds a box to posts and pages that shows the top 6 keywords from that post/page. Keyword density on posts and pages helps with search engine optimization and this tool will display the top words and their density. There is also a search box. If a word is not on the list, you can search for it and find the density of that word. You can also search for phrases. 

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the `orangesoda-keyword-density` folder and all its contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The keywords don't update automatically as I type, or the wrong number of words are displayed? =

Because wordpress uses Iframes to update post/pages, it is difficult to get the correct number of words. This is a feature that will be worked on and added soon!

= Words that don't matter are showing up... why? =

There is a word exclusion list, but it is difficult getting all the words that shouldn't be counted in the list. NOTE: Future release should have admin menu to add custom exclusion words...!
